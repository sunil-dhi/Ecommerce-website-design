            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as
                part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop.[1] The system can then be said to feed
                back into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback
                systems:

                Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the
                second and second system influences the first, leading to a circular argument. This makes reasoning
                based upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole.

                — Karl Johan Åström and Richard M.Murray, Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and
                Engineers[2].</p>
